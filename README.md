# passphraseme

A quick and simple cryptographically secure script to generate high entropy passphrases using [the Electronic Frontier Foundation's wordlists](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases), including their [fandom-inspired wordlists](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/08/dragon-con-diceware).

## Installation

```sh
pip3 install passphraseme
```

## Usage

Run `passphraseme` with a number to generate secure passphrases using EFF's short wordlist, like this:

```
$ passphraseme 7
plug-scan-skate-shown-ritzy-self-bud
$ passphraseme 5
drank-amino-spoil-badge-copy
```

You can also optionally choose a different wordlist. Here are all of the command line arguments:

| Short             | Long                        | Description                                                           |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-h`              | `--help`                    | show help message                                                     |
|                   | `--sep`                     | Separator (default "-")                                               |
| `-l`              | `--large`                   | Use EFF's general large wordlist                                      |
| `-s1`             | `--short1`                  | Use EFF's general short wordlist (default)                            |
| `-s2`             | `--short2`                  | Use EFF's short wordlist with unique prefixes                         |
| `-got`            | `--game-of-thrones`         | Use EFF's Game of Thrones wordlist (Passwords of Westeros)            |
| `-hp`             | `--harry-potter`            | Use EFF's Harry Potter wordlist (Accio Passphrase!)                   |
| `-st`             | `--star-trek`               | Use EFF's Star Trek wordlist (Live Long and Passphrase)               |
| `-sw`             | `--star-wars`               | Use EFF's Star Wars wordlist (The Passphrase Is Strong With This One) |
| `-d [dictionary]` | `--dictionary [dictionary]` | Custom wordlist filename                                              |

For example, you can choose to EFF's short wordlist with unique prefixes like this:

```
$ passphraseme -s2 5
leftover-human-podiatrist-clergyman-elk
```

Or you can embrace your inner nerd and use a fandom wordlist:

```
$ passphraseme --game-of-thrones 5
skull-putting-twenty-aid-bluntly
$ passphraseme --harry-potter 5
summoning-jealous-loads-somehow-unregistered
$ passphraseme --star-trek 5
destroying-maximum-radiation-yells-causes
$ passphraseme --star-wars 5
duels-zett-rock-silenced-blockade
```

You can also choose to use a custom wordlist, like this:

```
$ passphraseme -d /usr/share/dict/words 7
Sphinx's-congas-adjudge-revalue-scotched-decapitations-scampered
```

And if you prefer, you can use a custom separator, like ` ` or `.` instead of `-`:

```
$ passphraseme --sep " " 5
drown elder drown sport hula
$ passphraseme --sep . 5
stage.stash.speak.shack.pound
```

## Strength of passphrases

This table shows the strength (bits of entropy) of `passphraseme`-generated passphrases of different lengths (1-10 words).

The brute force time is calculated like this:

I'm assuming you're using a passphrase for macOS 10.8+ (PBKDF2-SHA512) to
encrypt your disk with FileVault. According to [this post](https://medium.com/@iraklis/running-hashcat-v4-0-0-in-amazons-aws-new-p3-16xlarge-instance-e8fab4541e9b),
the password cracking tool [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) can guess
193,900 passphrases per second on an Amazon AWS p3.16xlarge instance, which
costs $24.48 per hour.

If an attacker is willing to spend up to $1 billion per day to guess your
passphrase, they can afford to run 1.7 million of these AWS instances at once,
meaning they can guess ~330 billion passphrases per second. On average, a brute
force attack will find the passphrase after searching half the keyspace, so the
times above are how long it takes to search half the keyspace.

Note that the time "3.88e19 y" means "3.88 x 10<sup>19</sup> years". Also note
that the brute force times will vary wildly, both much quicker or much slower,
depending on the hash function or [KDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function)
used -- basically, depending on what software you're using this passphrase with.
